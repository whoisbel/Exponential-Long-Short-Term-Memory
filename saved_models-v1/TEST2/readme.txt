EPOCHS: 70
LR: 0.01
Purpose: Optimize for both speed and precision in modeling multi-scale trends (daily volatility + mid-term cycles).

Explanation:

Why 70 Epochs?
Balances ELU’s faster convergence with the need to capture mid-term dependencies (e.g., quarterly trends). Early stopping may still terminate training early if loss stabilizes.

Why LR=0.01?
Maintains the same aggressive rate as Pairing 1 but with more time to refine predictions. ELU’s gradient stability helps avoid overshooting minima despite noisy stock data.
