EPOCHS: 55
LR: 0.01
Purpose: Validate if marginal epoch increases enhance performance without sacrificing speed.

Explanation:

Why 55 Epochs?
A slight reduction from Pairing 1 (50 epochs) to test if minimal extra training improves robustness. Aligns with early stopping’s patience=15.

Why LR=0.01?
Reiterates ELU’s tolerance for aggressive updates. Tests whether short-but-slightly-longer training improves adaptation to abrupt shifts (e.g., flash crashes).
